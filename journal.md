Got started on the project today. Watched some youtube videos and decided to just jump right in. The stack is probably gonna look something like Airbyte > Dagster > some kind of data warehouse or deltalake > idk about BI tools. Took a minute setting up the Amazon EC2 instance - I wanted to try my hand at using terraform. Then I wanted to be able to set up and tear down infra on my Windows laptop, which required me to utilize devcontainers, since I prefer to handle everything in linux.
